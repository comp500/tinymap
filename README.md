TinyMap is a lightweight server-side web map, which allows viewing a map of your world in a browser. Similar to [Dynmap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynmapforge), but simpler and more lightweight.

## How to use
Drop it into your mods folder and start the server (or client if you really want, it works but isn't terribly useful). Once you've started a world, it will say `Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, which is the URL you can use to view it in your browser.

If you aren't using the same computer to view the map, you'd need to replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP of your server, and if necessary port forward port 8080.
